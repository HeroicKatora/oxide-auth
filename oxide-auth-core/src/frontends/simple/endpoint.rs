/// Substitue all parts that are not provided with the marker struct [`Vacant`]. This will at least
/// ensure that no security properties are violated. Some flows may be unavailable when some
/// primitives are missing. See [`AuthorizationFlow`], [`AccessTokenFlow`], [`ResourceFlow`] for
/// more details.
///
/// Included types are assumed to be implemented independently, with no major connections. All
/// attributes are public, so there is no inner invariant.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// You should prefer this implementation when there are special requirements for your [`Endpoint`]
/// implementation, or it is created ad-hoc. It also does some static type checking on dedicated
/// methods to ensure that the creation of specific flows succeeds. You should prefer
/// `to_authorization`, `to_access_token`, and `to_resource` over the erroring preparation methods
/// in [`AuthorizationFlow`], [`AccessTokenFlow`], and [`ResourceFlow`] respectively.
///
/// This should not be used when you special interacting primitives are used, that originate from
/// outside this library. For example if you intend for your [`Scopes`] to be dynamically generated
/// from a list of registered clients, its likely cleaner to provide your own [`Endpoint`]
/// implementation instead.
///
/// ## Example 
///
/// Here is an example where a `Generic` is used to set up an endpoint that is filled with the
/// minimal members to be useable for an [`AccessTokenFlow`].
///

/// optional reference trait for all solicitors in one way but in a different way for the `None`
/// solicitor.

///
