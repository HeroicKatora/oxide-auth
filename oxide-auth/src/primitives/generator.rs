//! Generators produce string code grant and bearer tokens for a determined grant.
//!
//! In short, a code grant needs to encapsulate information about the owner, client, redirect_uri,
//! scope, and lifetime of a grant. This information needs to be uniquely recoverable.
//!
//! Two major implementation exists:
//!     - `RandomGenerator` depends on the entropy of the generated token to make guessing
//!     infeasible.
//!     - `Assertion` cryptographically verifies the integrity of a token, trading security without
//!     persistent storage for the loss of revocability. It is thus unfit for some backends, which
//!     is not currently expressed in the type system or with traits.
use super::grant::Grant;

/// Generic token for a specific grant.
///
/// The interface may be reused for authentication codes, bearer tokens and refresh tokens.
///
/// ## Requirements on implementations
///
/// When queried without repetition (users will change the `usage` counter each time), this
/// method MUST be indistinguishable from a random function. This should be the crypgraphic
/// requirements for signature schemes without requiring the verification property (the
/// function need no be deterministic). This enables two popular choices: actual signature
/// schemes and (pseudo-)random generators that ignore all input.
///
/// The requirement is derived from the fact that one should not be able to derive the tag for
/// another token from ones own. Since there may be multiple tokens for a grant, the `usage`
/// counter makes it possible for `Authorizer` and `Issuer` implementations to differentiate
/// between these.
pub trait TagGrant {
    /// For example sign the input parameters or generate a random token.
