//! Polymorphic HTTP wrappers for code grant authorization and other flows.
//!
//! An endpoint is concerned with executing the abstract behaviours given by the backend in terms
//! of the actions of the endpoint types. This means translating Redirect errors to the correct
//! Redirect http response for example or optionally sending internal errors to loggers. The
//! frontends, which are the bindings to particular server libraries, can instantiate the endpoint
//! api or simple reuse existing types.
//!
//! To ensure the adherence to the oauth2 rfc and the improve general implementations, some control
//! flow of incoming packets is specified here instead of the frontend implementations.  Instead,
//! traits are offered to make this compatible with other endpoints. In theory, this makes
//! endpoints pluggable which could improve testing.
//!
//! Custom endpoint
//! ---------------
//! In order to not place restrictions on the web server library in use, it is possible to
//! implement an endpoint completely with user defined types.
//!
//! This requires custom, related implementations of [`WebRequest`] and [`WebResponse`].
//! _WARNING_: Custom endpoints MUST ensure a secure communication layer with confidential clients.
//! This means using TLS for communication over https.
//!
//! After receiving an authorization grant, access token or access request, initiate the respective
//! flow by collecting the [`Authorizer`], [`Issuer`], and [`Registrar`] instances. For example:
//!
//! [`WebRequest`]: trait.WebRequest.html
//! [`WebResponse`]: trait.WebResponse.html
//! [`Authorizer`]: ../../primitives/authorizer/trait.Authorizer.html
//! [`Issuer`]: ../../primitives/issuer/trait.Issuer.html
//! [`Registrar`]: ../../primitives/registrar/trait.Registrar.html
