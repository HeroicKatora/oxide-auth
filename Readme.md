oxide-auth
==============
A OAuth2 server library, for use in combination with [actix] or other frontends, featuring a set of configurable and pluggable backends.

About
--------------
`oxide-auth` aims at providing a comprehensive and extensible interface to
managing oauth2 tokens on a server. While the core package is agnostic of the
used frontend, an optional actix and a rouille adaptor is provided with the
default configuration. Through an interface designed with traits, the frontend
is as easily pluggable as the backend.

Example
-------------

> `$ cargo run --example actix`

In the [example folder] you can find an [interactive example]. This configures
a server, registers a public client and initializes a resource requiring an
authorization token. A client is also activated which can be used to access the
resource. The example assumes the user to be the validated resource owner, who
can deny or allow the request by the client.

Frontends
---------

These server libraries are integrated:

| Name | Feature | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| `actix` | `actix-frontend`, default | Still `0.7`, includes integration into messages |
| `rocket` | `oxide-auth-rocket`, nightly | - |
| `rouille` | `oxide-auth-rouille` | - |
| `iron` | `oxide-auth-iron` | - |

A more or less comprehensive list of changes is contained in the
[changelog][CHANGES]. Sometimes less as larger releases and reworks profit from
a rough overview of the changes more than a cumulative list of detailed
features.

suggestions but sometimes the associate workload can seem daunting. That means
that simplifications to the workflow are also *highly* appreciated.
