Contributing
============

Help in development is always welcome!  Whether you have a bugfix, new
features, new ideas or just want to correct a typo in some documentation, the
easiest way to track its progress is by opening a tracking issue.

In case you already have working code - even better. Simply link the pull
request in the issue. If you have not done so already, you may also add
yourself to the [list of constributors][contributors]. If you do not have code
ready to be shared, you should be added by whoever resolves your issue.

Please respect that I maintain this on my own currently and have limited time.
I appreciate suggestions but sometimes the associate workload can seem
daunting. That means that simplifications to the workflow are also *highly*
appreciated. I may also not get back to you immediately.

By contributing code, you agree to make it available under both MIT license and
Apache-2.0 license at the choice of the licensee and assure that you have the
rights to do so (the Github terms of service also require this from You).

This project generally follows a **full disclosure principle**.  We believe
that vulnerabilities are fixed most swiftly when shared openly. As this project
is mainly a library and not end-user software, it also enables other developers
to react in an informed manner.  Should you nevertheless believe this method to
be inappropriate, you may discuss bugs over [encrypted e-mail][pgp-key].
